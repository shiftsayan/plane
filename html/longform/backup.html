<p>It is time to elect a new exec board for ScottyLabs. In case you didn't know, ScottyLabs elects a new exec board each year based on nominations from all members. Thank you in advance for reading this long email, it has a lot of important information about elections!</p>

<p>You can nominate anyone, including yourself, for any exec board position(s). Who the nominations are from will be anonymous to everyone but myself, Sayan Chaudhry. <b>Please fill out <a href="https://href.scottylabs.org/election">this nomination form</a> before today 03/22 at 9:00pm ET.</b> After this deadline, I will be contacting people who were nominated for positions, and they may choose to accept any/all of their nominations up until Wednesday, 03/24 at 9:00pm EDT. <b>Elections for Director, Director of Design, and Director of Technology will take place during our GBM on Thursday 03/25 at 6:00pm ET over <a href="https://href.scottylabs.org/zoom">Zoom</a>.</b> The remaining positions will be filled in next week's GBM. If some nominee cannot make it to the Zoom meeting, they will be able to submit a 3 minute video explaining why they are a good fit for the position(s) they were nominated for.</p>

<p>The positions on the exec board are mostly the same as last year with the addition of Chief of Staff.

<p>Running an exec board position may sound intimidating, but have confidence in yourself! To quote Mark Vella (Director of ScottyLabs 2015-2016): "The question you need to ask yourself is 'Am I so passionate about ScottyLabs that I'd like to take charge and direct the future of this organization?' All other questions can be answered in due time." Furthermore, all previous exec board members will support you so that whoever fills each position succeeds. We and the rest of ScottyLabs have got your back!</p>
